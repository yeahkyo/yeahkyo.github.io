Let's begin with tiny pieces of things that I've already met with about migrating
your iOS app to iOS 9.

#### App Transport Security. Aka ATS
iOS 9 requires all content from internet downloaded via SSL. So we should check our
app's CDN or something, to make sure they support HTTPS.
Event thongh you can set NSAppTransportSecurity with a key-value pair NSAllowsArbitaryLoads:YES
in application's info.plist to make your app work well temporary, but when you determine to support
iOS 9, it will be good for you to adop ATS.


#### UIWindow must have a root view controller
It's a good practice to set root view controller to all windows that appear in your
app. From iOS 9 on, it's the only way preventing your app from crash.
I thought this might be important for supporting multiple window in iOS 9, which is
really a good new feature.
